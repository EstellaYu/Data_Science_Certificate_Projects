l# Anlayzing District test data

## 2: Academy of Py

In this task, the district-wide standardized test results are analyzed. 

The data includes every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. The analysis includes aggregating the data and showing  trends in school performance.

The report includes each of the following:

### District Summary

* Create a high level snapshot (in table form) of the district's key metrics, including:
  * Total Schools
  * Total Students
  * Total Budget
  * Average Math Score
  * Average Reading Score
  * % Passing Math
  * % Passing Reading
  * Overall Passing Rate (Average of the above two)

### School Summary

* Create an overview table that summarizes key metrics about each school, including:
  * School Name
  * School Type
  * Total Students
  * Total School Budget
  * Per Student Budget
  * Average Math Score
  * Average Reading Score
  * % Passing Math
  * % Passing Reading
  * Overall Passing Rate (Average of the above two)

### Top Performing Schools (By Passing Rate)

* Create a table that highlights the top 5 performing schools based on Overall Passing Rate. Include:
  * School Name
  * School Type
  * Total Students
  * Total School Budget
  * Per Student Budget
  * Average Math Score
  * Average Reading Score
  * % Passing Math
  * % Passing Reading
  * Overall Passing Rate (Average of the above two)

### Bottom Performing Schools (By Passing Rate)

* Create a table that highlights the bottom 5 performing schools based on Overall Passing Rate. Include all of the same metrics as above.

### Math Scores by Grade\*\*

* Create a table that lists the average Math Score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

### Reading Scores by Grade

* Create a table that lists the average Reading Score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

### Scores by School Spending

* Create a table that breaks down school performances based on average Spending Ranges (Per Student). Use 4 reasonable bins to group school spending. Include in the table each of the following:
  * Average Math Score
  * Average Reading Score
  * % Passing Math
  * % Passing Reading
  * Overall Passing Rate (Average of the above two)

### Scores by School Size

* Repeat the above breakdown, but this time group schools based on a reasonable approximation of school size (Small, Medium, Large).

### Scores by School Type

* Repeat the above breakdown, but this time group schools based on school type (Charter vs. District).

### A written description of at least two observable trends based on the data.
